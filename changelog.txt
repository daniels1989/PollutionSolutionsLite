  Notes:
    - Attempted to re-balance HEV Suit cost.
    - Attempts to add very basic barebones compat (just tech tree inserts for now) between Rampant Industry, Nauvis Melange, and ModMash Splinter's Alien Ooze. Did basic repairs to the WIP Xeno Nest to test functionality, but left disabled due to being over-powered for my personal purposes (and not knowing how to make a toggle).

toxic=Toxic

[entity-description]
pollutioncollector=To build a collector, harvest red xenomass from alien nests.
toxic-incinerator=Incinerates toxic sludge to generate heat. Create sludge in a chemical plant.
low-heat-exchanger=Uses heat to boil water at a temperature suitable for steam engines.
toxic-turret=Spews raw toxic sludge at enemies. This heavily pollutes the environment, but does not start fires.
dump-site=Pipe in pollution or toxic sludge to release a deadly gas that slows and kills biological creatures. Even a tiny amount is highly lethal.
toxic-waste-treatment=Extracts useful products from toxic sludge. Create sludge in a chemical plant.
domesticated-nest=An alien nest that produces xenomass when fed pollution or toxic sludge.
